# M3-Exc
Martini 3-exc parameters and structure files of the system used for reparametrization. 

M3-exc_SIMULATION_FILES.zip contains the .gro and .top files of the Martini systems, as they were used and described in the publication (see below).
The Martini 3-exc force field file, the .itp topology files of the excipients, and a jupyter script to change the bead types of a protein topology to the Marini 3-exc bead types are found in M3Files.zip
